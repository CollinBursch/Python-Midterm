# The Procedure class should have the following attributes - 
# Name of the procedure, Date of the procedure, Name of the practitioner who performed the procedure,
# Charges for the procedure and patient ID.
# The Procedure classâ€™s __init__ method should accept an argument for each attribute.
# The Procedure class should have accessor methods only for each attribute.
